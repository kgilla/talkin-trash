# Talkin' Trash

Talkin' Trash is a website made based on the Node.JS curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). This website was made to further my understanding of creating a back-end with express and also to introduce authentication with the help of Passport.JS.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement a local authorization strategy with [Passport.JS](http://www.passportjs.org/)
- Improve my understanding of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- Develop a better understanding of [PUG](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to partition stylesheets based on components
- Making a website more responsive to various viewports
- Improving my overall design ideas and layout structuring
- Making my code more modular and partitioned overall
